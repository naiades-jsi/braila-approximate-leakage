"""
The debitmeters/flowmeters provide pressure through the Analog 2 column, which registers a voltage change
depending on pressure. The number there is the raw voltage data that the debitmeter has recorded.

From that, to get the actual pressure data, you need to apply a formula of "(analoge-0.6)*4".

This is how the Siemens equipment functions. Sorry if it wasn't made clear to you previously.
If the value you get is negative, then it means the pressure sensor was non-functioning for that period of time, or
that the flow on that section of pipe was shut down for that period.
