This file is meant as a place holder for the functions that could be implemented to provide a full functionality
for the management of the water distribution networks.

Functions implementing the following papers should be implemented here:
- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705815026491
- https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/2/443/pdf

Functions should take in the EPANET network and locations of already existing sensors and return the optimal number of
locations for the N sensors that are available for placement.
